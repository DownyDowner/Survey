# Polls Web API

This project is a **Web API** designed to manage and handle polling data. It uses **PostgreSQL** as the database, **Entity Framework Core** as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), and **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user management and authentication. Additionally, the project includes a front-end built with **Vue.js** and the **Vuetify** UI library for a modern and responsive user interface.
